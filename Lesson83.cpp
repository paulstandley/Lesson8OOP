    /*Defining member functions outside the class definition

    All of the classes that we have written so far have been
    simple enough that we have been able to implement the member
    functions directly inside the class definition itself.

    However, as classes get longer and more complicated,
    having all the member function definitions inside the class
    can make the class harder to manage and work with.

    Using an already-written class only requires understanding
    its public interface (the public member functions),
    not how the class works underneath the hood.
    The member function implementation details just get in the way.

    Fortunately,
    C++ provides a way to separate the “declaration” portion of the class
    from the “implementation” portion.
    This is done by defining the class member functions
    outside of the class definition.

    To do so, simply define the member functions
    of the class as if they were normal functions,
    but prefix the class name to the function using the
    scope resolution operator (::) (same as for a namespace).

    Here is our Date class with the Date constructor and setDate()
    function defined outside of the class definition.
    Note that the prototypes for these functions still exist inside
    the class definition,
    but the actual implementation has been moved outside:

    Putting class definitions in a header file

    In the lesson on header files,
    you learned that you can put function declarations
    inside header files in order to use those functions
    in multiple files or even multiple projects.

    Classes are no different.
    Class definitions can be put in header files in order to facilitate
    reuse in multiple files or multiple projects.
    Traditionally, the class definition is put in a header file
    of the same name as the class,
    and the member functions defined outside of the class
    are put in a .cpp file of the same name as the class.

    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    Now any other header or code file that wants to use the Date class
    can simply #include "Date.h".
    Note that Date.cpp also needs to be compiled into any project
    that uses Date.h so the linker knows how Date is implemented.

    Doesn’t defining a class in a header file violate the one-definition rule?

    It shouldn’t. If your header file has proper header guards,
    it shouldn’t be possible to include the class definition more than
    once into the same file.

    Types (which include classes),
    are exempt from the part of the one-definition rule
    that says you can only have one definition per program.
    Therefore, there isn’t an issue #including class definitions into multiple
    code files (if there was, classes wouldn’t be of much use).

    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    Doesn’t defining member functions in the header violate the one-definition rule?

    It depends.
    Member functions defined inside the class definition
    are considered implicitly inline.
    Inline functions are exempt from the one definition per program
    part of the one-definition rule.
    This means there is no problem defining trivial member functions
    (such as access functions) inside the class definition itself.

    Member functions defined outside the class definition
    are treated like normal functions,
    and are subject to the one definition per program part of the one-definition rule.
    Therefore,
    those functions should be defined in a code file,
    not inside the header.
    The one exception for this is for template functions,
    which we’ll cover in a future chapter.

    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    So what should I define in the header file vs the cpp file,
    and what inside the class definition vs outside?

    You might be tempted to put all of your member function definitions
    into the header file, inside the class.
    While this will compile, there are a couple of downsides to doing so.
    First, as mentioned above, this clutters up your class definition.
    Second, if you change anything about the code in the header,
    then you’ll need to recompile every file that includes that header.
    This can have a ripple effect,
    where one minor change causes the entire program to need to recompile
    (which can be slow).
    If you change the code in a .cpp file,
    only that .cpp file needs to be recompiled!

    Therefore, we recommend the following:

    For classes used in only one file that aren’t generally reusable,
    define them directly in the single .cpp file they’re used in.

    For classes used in multiple files,
    or intended for general reuse,
    define them in a .h file that has the same name as the class.

    Trivial member functions
    (trivial constructors or destructors, access functions, etc…)
    can be defined inside the class.

    Non-trivial member functions should be defined
    in a .cpp file that has the same name as the class.

    In future lessons, most of our classes will be defined in the .cpp file,
    with all the functions implemented directly in the class definition.
    This is just for convenience and to keep the examples short.
    In real projects,
    it is much more common for classes to be put in their own code and header files,
    and you should get used to doing so.

    Default parameters

    Default parameters for member functions should be declared in the class
    definition (in the header file),
    where they can be seen by whomever #includes the header.

    Libraries

    Separating the class definition and class implementation is very
    common for libraries that you can use to extend your program.
    Throughout your programs,
    you’ve #included headers that belong to the standard library,
    such as iostream, string, vector, array, and other.

    Notice that you haven’t needed to add iostream.cpp,
    string.cpp, vector.cpp, or array.cpp into your projects.
    Your program needs the declarations from the header files
    in order for the compiler to validate you’re writing programs
    that are syntactically correct.

    However, the implementations for the classes that belong
    to the C++ standard library are contained in a precompiled file
    that is linked in at the link stage.
    You never see the code.

    Outside of some open source software
    (where both .h and .cpp files are provided),
    most 3rd party libraries provide only header files,
    along with a precompiled library file.

    There are several reasons for this: 1)
    It’s faster to link a precompiled library than to recompile
    it every time you need it, 2)
    a single copy of a precompiled library can be shared by many applications,
    whereas compiled code gets compiled into every executable that uses it
    (inflating file sizes), and 3)
    intellectual property reasons
    (you don’t want people stealing your code).

    Having your own files separated into declaration
    (header) and implementation (code file) is not only good form,
    it also makes creating your own custom libraries easier.
    Creating your own libraries is beyond the scope of these tutorials,
    but separating your declaration and implementation is a prerequisite to doing so.
